## Rules

The game consists of players taking turns in placing rings to the game board.
The player who first manages to form one of the special patterns wins the game.
There are three different sizes of rings: big, medium, and small. Each player
has three of each size.

### Winning patterns

**Full Stack**: A player forms a full stack by having three of their rings in
the same location. This means having big, medium, and small ring all in the
same spot.

**Three of Same**: If a player places three rings of the same size in a line.
The line can be horizontal, vertical, or diagonal.

**Three in sequence**: If a player places three rings of decreasing (or
increasing) size in a line. The line can be horizontal, vertical, or diagonal.
